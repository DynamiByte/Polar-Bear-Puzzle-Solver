susroot is bad


Hah I remember this

it was for the SHITPOST discord server...

used to be gg/shitpost, but I think some other server uses that now...

This code is god awful but ig it works.

It was created for a silly discord bot by the owners of SHITPOST called Yotsuba.
Yes, based on that Yotsuba.
It did some nsfw things so it was kinda weird but ehhh whatever.



I wonder if anyone from SHITPOST will see this... idk
if so, my discord accounts that I use most right now
